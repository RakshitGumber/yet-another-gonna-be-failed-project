# Do Next

- Linux Namespace
- On Linux, try commands like unshare, chroot, pivot_root, mounting /proc in a private mount namespace.
- Then read “Sandboxing Code in Rust” + “Better Sandboxing in Rust” to see how Rust folks apply the concepts.
- Use containers or minimal chroot jails to experiment.
- Start by forking into a child. In the child: drop privileges, close fds, set up a limited environment (maybe chroot).
- Then exec a simple binary (maybe one you wrote) inside that environment.
- Expand to use clone/unshare syscalls to create new mount namespace, PID namespace, user namespace, etc.
- Bind mount only necessary paths (e.g. bin, lib) into the new root.
- Use libcap (or equivalent in Rust) to remove capabilities.
- Limit syscalls (e.g. via seccomp filters) if you need stricter control.
- Try forcing directory traversal, mounting tricks, .., open file descriptors, etc.

- Learn Rust
- Experiment: Run something isolated
- Embed a mini event loop / executor

- Process isolation / sandboxing
  `Techniques: namespaces (Linux), seccomp filters, cgroups, chroot, container runtimes, syscall filtering.`
- Child process management
  `Spawning, capturing stdout/stderr, timeouts, resource limits (memory, CPU), killing runaway processes.`
- Task scheduling / executor
  `How to drive Futures (in Rust) or goroutines (in Go) and coordinate I/O.`
- Embedding / interfacing with user code
  `Running user-supplied code in a controlled context (e.g. under a VM, interpreter, or WASM sandbox).`
- Test harness / runner
  `Infrastructure to run multiple test cases automatically, collect results, handle failures, and output feedback`
- Drop privileges / capabilities after isolation
- Close file descriptors
