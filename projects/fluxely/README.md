# Fluxely

A no-code automation engine.

## How it started?

Back in January 2025, I applied for a job for a software developer role. the company ask was to make an app within 5 days to get qualified for the next round.

It was a basic AI app that uses Gemini to summarize the text. the company demand was to make a react flow project where I had to create 5 nodes of my choice and a text node that uses markdown editor.

It was my first time working with FastAPI and python itself. It took me several attempts to understand what I was making but I submitted the prototype within the time limit.

And they never reached out to me. ðŸ˜…

## How it went ahead?

This wasn't a stop for me in June I was about to leave programming at all. But, I thought of giving this app a shot because it was perfect for the first project after the capstone one.

I really went all in for this project I created a notion page where I started to record all the next task. After my job my everyday work was to finish the next task soon.

I was posting this daily over the Twitter(x.com). I was reaching at a point where I could say that I am actually building something.

But, soon the chronic demotivations came in and I stopped working on this at all.

## Why not give up?

After all this now I am back at working on this project. ðŸ˜‰

Remember there is a reason why this repo is yet another **Failed** project. This repo isn't about recording the success, this is about recording all the learning from the projects.

# Things I learned after continuing this project for the 3rd time

## Creating the new MVP

I am starting with creating the MVP at first. I actualy had an MVP but the project is changed a lot. So, I am working back on creating the MVP.

The MVP will have the following features

- ReactFlow Editor
- Database connection and local store for saving the nodes.
- Runner - The core mechanic I am working on. This is the reason I am creating the MVP again. I want it to be really extensible able to run on computer locally through CLI and on browser.
- CLI Tool - The CLI first approach.
