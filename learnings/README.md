# Learning

I had created the notes for each concept I had learned and daily logs to keep a track of my day to day routine.

## Novemeber - 2025

I finally got a new job as a software developer. Finally, I can leave my old job. Now, I will be able to dedicate all my time to learning and expanding this list. I will be working on more projects.
