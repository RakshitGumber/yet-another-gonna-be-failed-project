# Yet Another Gonna Be Failed Project

I am glad that I am writting all these.

This is a collection for all my projects, learnings and thought processes as I grow as a Developer.

This repository is my **personal lab** where I build, break, cry and rebuild(sometimes 😶). A documentation for all the learnings.

A continous process of learning and crying.

## 🧩 Philosophy

It's not about how much knowledge I was able to learn. It's about how much I am able to share.

Every project here is:

1. A lesson
2. Maybe I didn't finished them
3. Something you can definitely learn _something_ from
